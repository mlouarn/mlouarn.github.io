<h3>LCodent LCréent</h3>
<p>L Codent L Créent is an <a=href”https://wikis.univ-lille1.fr/chticode/wiki/ecoles/lclc/2018/home”>initiative</a> from Lille (France) to raise awareness among junior high school (secondary) student, focusing on girls, to programming. Those workshop are mentored by women doing PhD in computer sciences with various background. This is based on creativity, as the code is meant to create a graphical picture, using basis of programming.<br />
You can see the works of the Rennes’ students here: <a href="http://lclc-rennes.irisa.fr/">LCLC</a>. I participated as a mentor in 2019 and again in 2020 at the Bourgchevreuil junior high school (Cesson-Sévigné (France))
