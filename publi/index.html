                <h2>Increasing life science resources re-usability using semantic web technologies</h2>

		<strong>Abstract</strong>  In life sciences, current standardization and integration efforts are directed towards reference data and knowledge bases. However, original studies results are generally provided in non standardized and specific formats. In addition, the only formalization of analysis pipelines is often limited to textual descriptions in the method sections. Both factors impair the results reproducibility, their maintenance and their reuse for advancing other studies. Semantic Web technologies have proven their efficiency for facilitating the integration and reuse of reference data and knowledge bases.<br />
		We thus hypothesize that Semantic Web technologies also facilitate reproducibility and reuse of life sciences studies involving pipelines that compute associations between entities according to intermediary relations and dependencies.<br />
		In order to assess this hypothesis, we considered a case-study in systems biology (<a href="http://regulatorycircuits.org">http://regulatorycircuits.org</a>), which provides tissue-specific regulatory interaction networks to elucidate perturbations across complex diseases. Our approach consisted in surveying the complete set of provided supplementary files to reveal the underlying structure between the biological entities described in the data.We relied on this structure and used Semantic Web technologies (i) to integrate the Regulatory Circuits data, and (ii) to formalize the analysis pipeline as SPARQL queries.<br />
		Our result was a 335,429,988 triples dataset on which two SPARQL queries were sufficient to extract each single tissuespecific regulatory network.<br />

                <h2>Constraint-based verification of a modile app-game designed for nudging people to attend cancer screening</h2>

		<strong>Abstract</strong> In Norway, cervical cancer prevention involves the participation of as many eligible women aged 25-69 years as possible. However, reaching and inviting every eligible women to attend cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination is difficult. Using social nudging and gamification in modern means of communication can encourage the participation of unscreened people. Simula Research Laboratory together with the Cancer Registry of Norway have developed FightHPV, a mobile app game intended to inform adolescent and eligible women about cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination while they play and, to facilitate their further participation to prevention campaigns. However, game design and health information transfer can be hard to reconcile, as the design of each game episode is more guided by the release of information than gameplay and playing difficulty. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based model of FightHPV to evaluate the difficulty of each episode and to help the game designer in improving the player experience. This approach is relevant to facilitate social nudging of eligible women to participate to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination, as shown by the initial deployment of FightHPV and tests performed in focus groups. The design of this mobile app can thus be regarded as a new application case of Artificial Intelligence techniques such as gamification and constraint programming.<br />
